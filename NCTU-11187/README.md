# NCTU-11187 - Bar Codes

A bar-code symbol consists of alternating dark and light bars, starting with a dark bar on the left. Each bar is a number of units wide. Figure 1 shows a bar-code symbol consisting of $4$ bars that extend over $1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7$ units. In general, the bar code $BC(n, k, m)$ is the set of all symbols with $k$ bars that together extend over exactly $n$ units, each bar being at most $m$ units wide. For instance, the symbol in Figure 1 belongs to $BC(7, 4, 3)$ but not to $BC(7, 4, 2)$. Figure 2 shows all $16$ symbols in $BC(7, 4, 3)$. Each `1` represents a dark unit, each `0` a light unit.
