# NCTU-10512 - The Never Ending Towers of Hanoi

In 1883, Edward Lucas invented, or perhaps reinvented, one of the most popular puzzles of all times – the Tower of Hanoi, as he called it – which is still used today in many computer science textbooks to demonstrate how to write a recursive algorithm or program. First of all, we will make a list of the rules of the puzzle:
* There are three pegs: A, B and C.
* There are n disks. The number n is constant while working the puzzle.
* All disks are different in size.
* The disks are initially stacked on peg A so that they increase in size from the top to the bottom.
* The goal of the puzzle is to transfer the entire tower from the A peg to the peg C.
* One disk at a time can be moved from the top of a stack either to an empty peg or to a peg with a larger disk than itself on the top of its stack.
Your job will be to write a program which will show a copy of the puzzle on the screen step by step, as you move the disks around. This program has to solve the problem in an efficient way.

**TIP:**
It is well known and rather easy to prove that the minimum number of moves needed to complete
the puzzle with n disks is 2^(n − 1).

## Input

The input file will consist of a series of lines. Each line will contain two integers n, m. n, lying within the range [1, 250], will denote the number of disks and m, belonging to [0, 2^(n − 1)], will be the number of the last move, you may assume that m will also be less than 2^16, and you may also assume that a good algorithm will always have enough time. The file will end at a line formed by two zeros.

---
## Output

The output will consist again of a series of lines, formatted as show below.
**NOTES:**
* There are 3 spaces between de ‘=>’ and the first number printed. If there isn’t any number, there should be no spaces.
* All the disks in a single peg are printed in a single line (not as in the Problem #1 below).
* Print a blank line after every problem.
