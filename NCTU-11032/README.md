# NCTU-11032 - Happy Number

Let the sum of the square of the digits of a positive integer S0 be represented by S1. In a similar way, let the sum of the squares of the digits of S1 be represented by S2 and so on. If Si = 1 for some i >= 1, then the original integer S0 is said to be Happy number. A number, which is not happy, is called Unhappy number. For example $$7$$ is a Happy number since 7 → 49 → 97 → 130 → 10 → 1 and 4 is an Unhappy number since 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4.
