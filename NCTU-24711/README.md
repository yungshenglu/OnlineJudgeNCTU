# NCTU-24711 - Rare Easy Problem

N is a random number, which for some reason, is at least two digits. John Doe, a nondescript man, performs an operation on N: he chops off the last digit to form a new number M, and then finds N − M. This excites him in a hard-to-justify way. He then tells you N − M. Thrilled by the fascinating back-story behind this number, you make it your life goal to figure out what N was. By the way, John was later eaten by a tiger.
