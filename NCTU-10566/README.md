## Input

Each line of input contains eight floating point numbers: the $(x, y)$ coordinates of one of the endpoints of the first side followed by the $(x, y)$ coordinates of the other endpoint of the first side, followed by the $(x, y)$ coordinates of one of the endpoints of the second side followed by the $(x, y)$ coordinates of the other endpoint of the second side. All coordinates are in meters, to the nearest mm. All coordinates are between $−10000$ and $+10000$. Input is terminated by end of file.

## Output

For each line of input, print the $(x, y)$ coordinates of the fourth point of the parallelogram in meters, to the nearest mm, separated by a single space.
